# Sustainable Smart City Assistant - Using AI

## About the Project
We designed a simple Smart City Assistant to help people with daily information like traffic, water saving tips, energy usage, and air quality. This project is made to support sustainable development in cities.

## What This Assistant Can Do
- Gives traffic updates (simulated)  
- Suggests ways to save water  
- Provides energy saving tips  
- Shares air quality information  

## How We Made It
- Used Python to build a chatbot simulation  
- Tested the assistant using Google Colab  
- Project files, demo screenshots, and video are in this repository  

## How to Use
1. Open the file from the Project Files folder  
2. Run the code  
3. Ask questions like:  
   - "How is the traffic today?"  
   - "How to save water?"  
   - "Tell me about air quality"  
4. Assistant replies with answers  

## Conclusion
This is a simple prototype for Smart City solutions. With more tools like IBM Granite LLM, we can make this assistant smarter and connect it to real city systems.
